Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of the array
Second line contains, n elements of integers in a array.

Output Description:
Print the number of permutations of A that are squareful.
